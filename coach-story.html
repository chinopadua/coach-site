                  <p class="sec-text">Founder Jim Nicholls arrived in Indonesia in 1997 to process re-engineer the mining and heavy-equipment divisions of the Country’s biggest cement factory. Within a few weeks, Jim knew he would fail using a Western Approach. Overcoming core obstacles, including language, cultural and motivational differences seeded the ideas of simplified systems and tactical approaches that respect, honor and utilize local custom and culture.</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">After a string of successful projects in Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and Taiwan, Jim registered companies in Manila and Bangkok in 2007. </p>
                  <p class="sec-text">These two companies pioneered the simplification of Western designed Management Control Systems so that the workforces of South-East Asian companies could find them easy to understand, easy to learn and easy to teach.</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">Hong Kong followed in 2010, as a strategic location to consolidate ownership of intellectual property, to develop new products, services and business relationships, and from which to internationalize the brands <strong>COACH Approach® </strong>and <strong>simplifiCOACHing®.</strong></p>
                  <p class="sec-text"><strong>COACH </strong>systems and approaches are developed on the fundamental belief that Western designed management implementation styles are ineffective in Asian environments due to cultural, historical, economic and social differences. Western systems do not adequately address the needs of the unique aspects of Asian working culture, how to implement and sustain change.</p>

                  <p class="sec-text">The pace of change is so fast these days. Even if business leaders are adept to changing conditions, their workforce cannot keep up. This is a huge challenge for today’s leaders.</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">To succeed today everyone must get better… better, faster, smarter, more disciplined, more effective and easier to manage</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">There is so much information available to help improve and bring clarity that it often does more to confuse. </p>
                  <p class="sec-text">How refreshing then is it to learn that the <strong>COACH Approach® </strong>simplifies management control systems so the workforce finds it easier to understand, easier to learn and easier to teach? …and how refreshing is it to learn that <strong>simplifiCOACHing®</strong>, the heartbeat of the <strong>COACH Approach®</strong>, transforms your workforce to have better work habits, voluntary discipline, be more compliant and require less supervision and management?</p>

                  <p class="sec-text">Our ambition is to introduce the <strong>COACH Approach® </strong>and <strong>simplifiCOACHing® </strong>to as many people and organizations as possible, and to apply it wherever it can make a difference.</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">Everyday our COACHes are working directly with workers. Many are from humble backgrounds and live in humble circumstances. Working beside them is a privilege, it gives us a unique first-hand insight into their problems hopes and dreams, both at work and at home. Humble perhaps, though we frequently see these ordinary folk produce extraordinary performance. <br>The <strong>COACH Approach® </strong>imparts attitudes and skills that they can apply at home, and workers tell us they do just that.</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">This brings us to believe <strong>The COACH Approach® </strong>can help communities and we are keen to see if it does. Application of <strong>COACH </strong>systems in community environments is something we’d like to try.</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">In the meantime, we are happy to support NGO’s and non-profit organizations in making their funding go further through better outcomes.</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">Commercially, <strong>COACH Approach® </strong>will expand its licensing program to partner with talented organizations throughout ASEAN and beyond to South Asia and the Far East. </p>
                  <p class="sec-text"><strong>SimplifiCOACHing®</strong>, the heartbeat of <strong>The COACH Approach®</strong>, will be offered as a stand-alone learning system to human development organizations wanting to elevate their business out of ‘transfer of knowledge’ and/or ‘mentoring’ to ‘sustainable change through practical application’.</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">Spreading the word... Education. <strong>COACH </strong>will collaborate with more Universities and Business Schools through Post Graduate Elective Courses with content high on practical application. What we learn from these courses will inspire the development of e-learning programs.</p>
                  <p class="sec-text">We will also partner with industry associations and advocacy organizations that promote National and International standards of ethics, integrity and well-being.</p>
